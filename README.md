# Hi there 👋 I'm Sophie!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a snowboarding instructor for 5 years and ride motorcycles!

I live in Oceanside CA, and am a Front End Developer! I like solving tough problems and actively learning new things. I love being outdoors and spending time riding my motorcycle, snowboarding and hanging out on the beach! If I'm not doing any of that I am rolling Jiu Jitsu or playing video games! Feel free to reach out and connect to talk about hobbies or projects!
